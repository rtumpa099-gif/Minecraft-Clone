It is a very simple Minecraft clone,
with basic controls made for mobile 
devices.
Fetures:-

1)simple movement.

2)one type of block placing.

3)any type of block breaking(even the
mob and sun).

4)the mob have very simple ai, which
just choses a random coordinate to go.

5)the 'UP' and 'DOWN' buttons are
supposed to work if the gravity for the
player is turned off(you can do it by
directly commenting out on line of code
from the gravity function).

6)I didn't added the wall collision 
correctly so u can walk through blocks
sometimes.
